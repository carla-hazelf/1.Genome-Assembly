# NOTE - This user-friendly tutorial is being periodically updated, and is in need of polishing!

The scripts for this project have been developed and used as part of the 'Kingfish/haku genomic resources'  project, which is supported by Genomics Aotearoa. You can find out more about it here: https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/our-work/te-ao-maori-projects/genomic-resources-selective-breeding-kingfish/haku

The scripts have been developed into a user-friendly tutorial format.
